# Login System using Node.js
Hey Friends,\
This project is for those who want to learn how to implement backend(Node.js) routes with the frontend(EJS based template).
This project is simple Login based application and once the user is logged in, the user can access the data of all users or can create a new user. 

## Usage
To access application UI based head towards:\
```https://nodejs-loginapp.herokuapp.com```\
I have hosted this application on the cloud-based platform Heroku.
For your local testing and access.
First clone the repo using
```
git clone https://github.com/Anshul-Sonpure/LoginSystem.git
```
Then open the repo in your IDE, if you love using VS Code Studio as I do then open a terminal and enter
```
npm start
```
You will see Server will start at localhost and port 3000. Access the application using the given user details.

## Lessons Learned
While building this application I learned about EJS, PUG template, and how we can use the HTML Form for login and Creating resources.
Future enhancements in this project will be update and delete part.

**NOTE** Try testing the routes in postman, you will learn something new that I also learned.

Thank You\
Happy Coding,\
Learn,Code and Earn\
Stay Safe and Stay Positive :)
